# BS**M**G Bot

This bot was specifically made for the bs**m**g. 

every 30 minutes, it takes a random word from the english dictionary starting with M, takes the first google image result of that letter, and then changes a discord server and logo to said word + image.

If you're not sure how to get the google images API keys, please refer to the [google-images github readme](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/google-images)
